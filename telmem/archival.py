ƒxyz Network
Financial Network based on (DIgital currencies) (and Digital identities)
Abstract
Everything is connected by data. Complex systems intertwine to form networks and to
understand them, we must map their architecture, transforming chaos – vast data and
networks – into something more structured and ordered.
There are two types of networks: physical (natural) and digital (relational). Money, a human
invention, often mirrors nature since we are also living organisms. In nature, everything
forms a network that communicates and obeys various rules and functions. Examples
include mycelium networks, Organisms, social networks, quantum networks (photons), and
financial networks.
Finance can be expressed through functions, specifically graph functions. Graphs represent
networks and their properties, while other factors are underlying rules that affect the network
or are part of it.
By analyzing the flow and protocols governing them we can do many things.

In this era of rapid technological advancements, the financial world is undergoing a
significant transformation. The emergence of digital currencies and digital identities
has paved the way for a new financial network that transcends traditional boundaries.
This network, which we call the ƒxyz net, aims to simplify complex financial networks
and streamline value transfer, exchange, and creation. By leveraging the power of
digital currencies and digital identities, we can create a more efficient, secure, and
transparent financial ecosystem that benefits all its participants.
Everything is interconnected and contains data. If we can connect to it or have a
member establish a connection, knowledge and value transfer can occur.
We will secure our members/nodes behind the guardians of Cube exchange and
encourage members to hold their assets off-chain, ensuring security. However, when
interacting with the financial world, digital or physical, members should be cautious
and calculate all possibilities.
If our members are present in both our network and other permissioned or
permissionless networks, we gain access to those as well, just like markets.
Natural networks function in separate groups with different missions but benefit the
whole system while giving back to it.
Giving back to our community benefits us greatly.
Standardizing and synchronizing the digital world with traditional finance with
standarts like FIBO ontology.
Humans are individuals with legal personhood and multiple personas, including
online identities. They need everything digital, including memory, reasoning, and
most importantly, value.
We are a value network that encrypts its user, value and organizational data to the
point that only accessible by the the ones with permission.Questions

Simplifying Complex Financial Networks
Streamlining value transfer, exchange, and creation
Why
The financial world is unnecessarily complex. By removing the noise and analyzing patterns,
we can better understand the flow of value and improve the efficiency of the system/network,
since everything is interconnected.
Currencies, our primary value representers, are mostly traded over-the-counter. This lack of
transparency and high-level access requirements create an environment where each layer
adds its own "secrets," empowering those who retain knowledge and sell it to the less
informed.How

Getting ready for the Q worldA Journey Through the Evolution of Money: The ƒxyz
Digital Currency Network
"If you don't rest upon the good foundation of nature, you will labor with little honor and less
profit."
Leonardo da Vinci
Let's dive into the story of the Fxyz digital currency network, how it became what it is today,
and where we're headed.
We wanted to make money transactions like sending, paying, and earning easier and
understand how currency markets work.
We found out that the over-the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange market is important for all
kinds of trades. Banks use it to adjust their foreign currency holdings and make money.
Following Money in a Complex Financial World
Can we track the flow of money? We can gather some information from sources like the
Federal Reserve, central banks, and various markets. However, the over-the-counter (OTC)
foreign exchange market, boasting a daily volume of over $7 trillion (as reported by the Bank
for International Settlements in 2022), is difficult to follow. Our primary source is the BIS
report, which is an estimate and only published every three years. We've tried talking to
brokers and markets, but they mostly trade derivatives and require significant capital for
access.
Additionally, there are informal money transfer networks like hawala, feinqian (flying cash),
and others. These networks are legal in places like the United Arab Emirates and Turkey
and operate in Asia, Africa, and even the US and EU, often under the radar.Take China, for instance. Peer-to-peer (P2P) and over-the-counter (OTC) markets for
exchanges like Huobi and OKEx continue to operate despite unclear cryptocurrency
regulations. Hong Kong and Dubai permit large transactions in various forms. Meanwhile,
mainland China is developing digital money called central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
They've already tested CBDCs and will soon implement them, joining many other countries
worldwide.
The Growth of Digital Money: Cryptocurrencies, Stablecoins, and CBDCs
Digital Currencies is becoming more popular, starting with Bitcoin. Bitcoin and other digital
currencies like Ethereum and Solana are easy to use and have many applications.
Governments are making their own digital money called Central Bank Digital Currencies
(CBDCs). This makes digital money more trusted and helps other types of digital money, like
stablecoins, work better.
Stablecoins are popular because they're good for transferring value. People use them for
trading and sending money. There are some risks, like using unsafe platforms and having
centralized issuers, but people try to reduce these risks.
We can't change the system completely, so we need to find a balance between different
types of money. We can do this by looking at information from banks, digital money
platforms, and other sources.
There are many layers in the financial system, like banks, payment apps, and digital
currencies. We can find connections between these layers by analyzing them properly.
Digital currency has advantages, like faster transactions and real-time calculations. This can
help us with activities like sending money, trading, and exchanging.
If we understand how the system works, we can fix problems and create value. We can
make money by transferring value or doing something useful.
Many organizations are trying to combine digital money and traditional money into one
system. But they still work within their own networks, not as one big network.
We want to make money without taking too much risk. We need to use human and machine
intelligence to manage our money better. If we work together and share information, we can
improve the financial system.History
After being forced to a small boutique team, we started to integrate new technologies and
see how we can keep building, researching, etc. We began implementing AI in different
fields like: (LagrangeHistoryURI)
●
●
●
●
●
Knowledgebase management - Knowledge Graphs
Semantic - chatbot, qa, doc management
Algorithmic trading - shortest path, triangular arbitrage, centrality, labeling, etc.
Different architectures of personal AI assistants
Data lifecycle
However, the last missing puzzle was moving everything into a graph database. We were
using and working with graph databases but not as the main thing, and some of our
algorithms were naturally graph-based, like shortest path finding.
Graph transition
So while keeping the underlying architecture of traditional databases, we started to feed
everything into a graph database, including the knowledge base for AI and vector indexes.
This way, both humans, machines, and models would have structured access to financial
information in a holistic way.
Connections Between Digital and Physical
We began building on Solana with the hope of increased liquidity in Serum, FTX, and
bridges, but both of those ideas failed.
But soon after we switched to open, modular and interconnected architecture.
FIX protocol is being modified, still remains one of the main ways of communication.
The Power of Graphs
We already discussed how everything is a network and networks are just graphs +
properties (or vice versa). Many big institutions, including central banks, are already using
graph databases in various cases, such as financial applications.(cite fna, and other BIs and
payments canafa).
More data here That is why we decided to switch to a graph database, making it easier to
compute, visualize, talk to, etc., for both humans and machines.
Integrating Graph DatabasesData and Ecosystems
Data is the building block of everything. Core data, the data that programs it and the data
that is tagged by - MasterData, MetaData, ProgramData(cite neo4j, solana) have their
attributes and interact with other elements in the ecosystem. Ecosystems have their own
rules/protocols that bind elements together, and this goes on until all is one, from where it
started.
Goals and Collective Organization
Our main goal is collecting data in a way that both humans and machines can interact with,
understand, and act upon. Humans can form groups and share thoughts through collective
organization tools like DAOs, and everyone can have their own collective.
Holacracy and the Future
We can rule with Holocracy, where leaders are heard but not just everyone in matters that
are domain-specific, and everyone has power when it comes to value/money, ideas, and
other pre-agreed things.
**more holocracy here**
DAOs & Holocracy
Holocracy is a decentralized management framework that allows organizations to operate
without a top-down hierarchy of managers and subordinates. It creates clear structure,
expectations, and boundaries while maintaining alignment. DAOs (Decentralized
Autonomous Organizations) are another form of decentralized management that rely on
automation and voting mechanisms. However, there are limitations to both systems when
used separately.
The challenge with DAOs is that they attempt to automate everything, but some aspects
require human judgment and are not best left to automated processes or voting. Holacracy,
on the other hand, is great at harnessing human wisdom to create a purpose-driven
governance structure.
The exciting potential lies in integrating the two systems. By combining Holacracy and
DAOs, organizations can benefit from the human judgment and wisdom of Holacracy while
leveraging the automation and voting mechanisms of DAOs. This hybrid approach allows for
a more dynamic and powerful organizational structure.
We're moving towards a DAO-Holacracy hybrid model by creating a foundation with a
governance structure that is run with Holacracy. We will also mint a new token to be
distributed among our licensees for certain decisions that require ratification or voting.This hybrid model works well for organizations that want the benefits of both decentralized
community governance and centralized management. It combines the decentralized
authority structure of Holacracy, which still allows humans to lead individual roles within clear
bounds, with the automation and voting mechanisms of DAOs.
Combining Holacracy and DAOs forms a dynamic hybrid model that captures the best of
both worlds, while tackling their limitations. This approach aims to reap the rewards of
decentralized community governance and centralized management.
Members
Members are anonymized and tied to pseudo wallets, email, and other types of identification
systems.
Each group has its own membership
We will give some sort of status, rating and other things to the users.
Different levels of privacy and anonymization:

after contact initiation."

Circles
Different people, groups, and companies have their own circle of connections, information
sharing, and other types of closed networks that we call circles.
They will be governed by their sub-dao or in a traditional way and to get access to the
internal data of data/information of the circle you have to connect to one of the members that
can refer to(unless it is stated as this) or you are accepted into that circle through some sort
of membership provenance like NFTs, tokenized contracts or different forms of traditional
contracts.
As these circles are governed internally by their members and their contributions can be
done through DAO itself or by members or both but roles and other tasks are assigned to an
individual member/person/persona that this entity has agreed itself.Roles

Security & Privacy & Anonymity
We stand by the idea of privacy and being as secure as we can while trusting by using
technology(verifying).
If someone is already in the digital realm(holding digital currency(crypto, stable, CBDC) they
somehow passed checks or are in a very risky possession.
The best thing to do is make it pseudonymous because we want something in the middle,
some entities, organizations, or internal sub-DAO members will have a way of checking
identity, funds, etc while not getting all the private data.
For this, we mainly plan to use Cubenet as it will act as a privacy and anonymization layer
on top of the existing technologies but their KYC checks will also help us to filter out the
unwanted/illegal value transfer and exchange.
We additionally plan to integrate with different zk protocols and technologies to be able to
offer more privacy/anonymity

We think that this is very obvious - the things that are going to happen are very obvious, and
we have been building mostly knowledge and network. We think that we have reached the
minimum required nodes to be effective and that we can spread out across multiple
dimensions, layers by calculating multiple variables and their outputs collectively and doing
what is best while benefiting the one - the network itself. Various individual elements are an
integral part of it, but the main goal here is acting as one: sharing wealth and knowledge and
evolving based on your findings, as you go.

Challenges

Regulatory and liquidity challenges will be solved by network members present in
different countries. Think of it as a mix of the banking system, hawala network, and
cryptocurrencies, which make it possible. One holds money in the digital world (many
blockchains) and in the physical world (many countries). If each entity is legally
compliant, then we don’t have to do the compliance for the whole network, and it can
act as a digital organism - network.
